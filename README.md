# Perforce-Files-Structure
Creation of production files struture for the Flex Studio team.

While studying at university for a final project we were a team of 5 artists that manage are projects has if we were a real studio. We named this team Flex Studio.  I was in charge of the layout, lighting, rendering and compositing. As a team working remotely, we created a series of 4 short cinematic using videogames and vfx tools such has Unreal engine, Maya, Houdini, Blender and Perforce for files sharing. The combination of a hybrid pipeline made it possible for us to share files and collaborate with efficiency. 

Also, I was responsible for file management. Since we were going to create many films, I coded a small application that helped me create files and starter projects for the unreal engine.

Having developed this solution made it possible for me to explore more into Python and to have a better understanding of the importance of having established guidelines for the efficiency of artits collaboration.
